    <p>In this blog, we’re diving into a topic that every aspiring IT technician needs to understand: <strong>Wi-Fi standards</strong>. Specifically, we’ll explore the different <strong>802.11 wireless standards</strong> that you’ll need to identify and differentiate on the CompTIA A+ exam. (And yes, Wi-Fi stands for “wireless internet” ,  for the cavemen in the back.)</p>

    <h2>What is 802.11?</h2>
    <p>The 802.11 standard was introduced in <strong>1997</strong> and laid the foundation for all modern wireless networking. It offered a then-impressive maximum speed of <strong>2 Mbps</strong> using the <strong>2.4 GHz</strong> frequency band. For perspective, that’s less than half the speed needed to stream a single 1080p video today ,  so it was functional, but basic by modern standards.</p>

    <h2>802.11b (1999)</h2>
    <p>Released in 1999, <strong>802.11b</strong> was the first major improvement. Like the original, it uses the <strong>2.4 GHz</strong> frequency but boosts the maximum bandwidth to <strong>11 Mbps</strong>. This was a major leap at the time, though it's still modest by today’s expectations. One big advantage of 2.4 GHz is its longer range, as the lower frequency travels farther and penetrates walls better than higher frequencies.</p>

    <h2>802.11a (1999)</h2>
    <p>Also introduced in 1999, <strong>802.11a</strong> took a different approach. Instead of using 2.4 GHz, it operated at <strong>5 GHz</strong>, offering much faster speeds ,  up to <strong>54 Mbps</strong>. However, that higher frequency came at a cost: range. A 5 GHz signal doesn't travel as far as 2.4 GHz and is more easily blocked by obstacles. Because of that, 802.11a didn’t see wide adoption in homes but found use in enterprise environments.</p>

    <h2>802.11g (2003)</h2>
    <p>In 2003, <strong>802.11g</strong> combined the best of both worlds. It kept the <strong>2.4 GHz</strong> frequency for longer range but offered speeds up to <strong>54 Mbps</strong>, just like 802.11a. This made it a popular standard for many years, providing solid performance and backwards compatibility with 802.11b devices.</p>

    <h2>802.11n (2008)</h2>
    <p>By 2008, Wi-Fi usage was skyrocketing, and <strong>802.11n</strong> came in to meet the demand. Also known as “Wireless-N,” this standard supported both <strong>2.4 GHz and 5 GHz</strong> bands (a feature called dual-band), allowing more flexibility and better performance in crowded environments. It also introduced <strong>MIMO (Multiple Input, Multiple Output)</strong> technology, using multiple antennas to improve speed and reliability. The minimum theoretical speed was <strong>72 Mbps</strong>, and under optimal conditions, it could reach up to <strong>600 Mbps</strong> ,  enough to stream around 100 HD videos simultaneously.</p>

    <h2>802.11ac (2014)</h2>
    <p>The most recent standard you’ll need to know for the A+ exam is <strong>802.11ac</strong>, introduced in <strong>2014</strong>. Like 802.11a, it operates only on the <strong>5 GHz</strong> band, but with a huge performance boost. It supports <strong>wave-based beamforming</strong> and expanded MIMO to push speeds up to nearly <strong>7 Gbps</strong> (that’s gigabits, not megabits ,  a whole new unit of measure). However, its reliance on the 5 GHz band does limit its range, and older devices without 5 GHz support can’t use it. Despite that, it’s become the standard in most modern routers and devices.</p>
