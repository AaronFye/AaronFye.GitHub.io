    <p>In this blog, we’re going to take a step back in time, or at least it will feel that way, by exploring the world of <strong>wired network connections</strong>. Although these technologies might seem a bit old-fashioned compared to wireless standards, they are still essential to understand for anyone preparing for the A+ certification exam. Let’s go through the main types you should know.</p>

    <h2>RJ-45 (Registered Jack 45)</h2>
    <p>First up, we have the highly recognizable <strong>RJ-45</strong> connector. The RJ stands for <em>Registered Jack</em>, as it was an officially registered design. RJ-45 is what most people think of when they hear “Ethernet port.” You’ve probably seen these on routers, switches, and computers, and they’re still in heavy use today, especially when Wi-Fi isn’t reliable or you need the absolute best performance. An RJ-45 connector uses <strong>eight wires</strong> inside the cable head to transmit data. These cables can also support <strong>PoE</strong> (Power over Ethernet), which supplies power through the same cable, making it convenient for devices like VoIP phones or security cameras. (More on PoE in a future blog, perhaps!)</p>

    <h2>RJ-11 (Registered Jack 11)</h2>
    <p>Next, let’s look at the RJ-45’s “little brother,” the <strong>RJ-11</strong> connector. This also stands for <em>Registered Jack</em>, but with a different numbering scheme. RJ-11 is commonly used for connecting traditional landline telephones. While it resembles RJ-45, it is smaller and uses only four wires instead of eight. If you’ve ever tried to plug an Ethernet cable into a phone jack and wondered why it wouldn’t fit, you probably confused these two connectors, don’t worry, you’re definitely not alone on that one. RJ-11 still exists today in some office environments and homes, mainly where analog phone systems remain active.</p>

    <h2>RS-232 (Recommended Standard 232)</h2>
    <p>Moving even further back, we come to the <strong>RS-232</strong> port, where RS stands for <em>Recommended Standard</em>, nothing screams 1960s like that! RS-232 is better known as the <strong>serial port</strong>. Before USB took over, serial ports were the go-to solution for connecting peripherals like printers, mice, and even dial-up modems. The RS-232 standard allowed devices to communicate data in a simple, point-to-point fashion. Today, you won’t see many RS-232 ports on consumer devices, but they do pop up in industrial and legacy systems, making them an important part of IT knowledge.</p>

    <h2>BNC (Bayonet Neill–Concelman)</h2>
    <p>Another interesting wired connector is the <strong>BNC</strong> connector, which stands for <em>Bayonet Neill–Concelman</em>, though hardly anyone ever uses the full name. A BNC connector is basically the terminal end of a <strong>coaxial cable</strong>. These connectors use a twisting bayonet-style lock to stay secure, which makes them more reliable than simply pushing in a cable. If you’ve ever connected an old television before HDMI took over, you probably used a BNC-type connector. That little pin inside the coaxial cable that connects to the port is what allows the signal to pass through securely.</p>

    <h2>RG-59 and RG-6 Coaxial Cables</h2>
    <p>To wrap up, let’s touch on the types of coaxial cables that pair with BNC connectors: <strong>RG-59</strong> and <strong>RG-6</strong>. RG, interestingly enough, stands for <em>Radio Guide</em>, which is quite a cool name for a humble cable. RG-59 is typically used for shorter distance video or CCTV applications because it supports less signal distance before degradation. On the other hand, RG-6 is built to handle longer cable runs with better shielding, making it more suitable for modern cable television and broadband installations. If you’ve ever had a cable technician visit your house, they probably worked with RG-6 coaxial to get you connected.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>While many of these wired technologies may feel outdated, they are still vital in IT and networking environments, especially for the A+ certification. Whether you’re working with Ethernet, phone systems, coaxial TV cables, or even industrial serial ports, understanding these standards helps build a strong technical foundation. Stay tuned, as we’ll dive even deeper into other networking concepts and technologies in future blogs. Wired or wireless, these connection types remain essential knowledge for anyone in the tech industry.</p>
